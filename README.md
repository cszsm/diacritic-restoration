##0. The first and most important: Collect data

Collected Information from:
- Webcorpus (600M words)
- 1 Million Facebook comments
- Books (P. Howard, JK Rowling, Tolkien, and freely available papers), all in hungarian

##1. Human-based test

Here we generate a TSV file based on hungarian books. From these documents we select only those words, where the word's deaccentized form can be equivalent to another existing word's deaccentized form.

In these TSV files we let people select that how many words did they use to be 100% sure that the word could be reaccentized based on the provided information.
